VibeFlow – Simple Offline Music Player (Android App)
VibeFlow is a basic offline music player built for Android using Java. It allows users to play audio files stored on their device with controls like play, pause, and skip. The app uses Android’s built-in media player and a simple UI built with XML layouts.

I created this project to explore Android development and understand how media playback works on mobile. It also helped me apply OOP concepts and improve my skills in working with activities, intents, and event listeners.
